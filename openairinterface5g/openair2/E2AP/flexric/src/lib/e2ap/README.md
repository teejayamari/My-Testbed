FlexRIC supports multiple O-RAN E2AP versions - v1.01/v2.03/v3.01.

By default, E2AP v2.03 is compiled. If you would like to change the version, please, execute this command:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DE2AP_VERSION=<e2ap_version> && make -j8
sudo make install
```
Note: Command `sudo make install` installs shared libraries that represent Service Models. Every time E2AP or/and KPM versions are modified, this command must be executed afterwards.


Note for developers: Due to conflicts with OpenAirInterface when building the E2 Agent, I decided to add a suffix to all the code generated by asn1c.
Therefore, the next steps need to be taken:

# Step 1
Generate the C files using asn1c e.g., /opt/asn1c/bin/asn1c -gen-APER -no-gen-OER -fcompound-names -no-gen-example -findirect-choice -fno-include-deps e2ap-v02.03.asn1
Optionally, pass the -S flag to specify where the directory with skeletons is found.

# Step 2
Generate the static library e.g., change the e2ap_asn1_obj at src/lib/e2ap/v1_01/ie/asn/CMakeLists.txt to STATIC instead of OBJECT

# Step 3
Change the paths in the script add\_suffix\_asn1c.py as well as the desired suffix.

#Step 4 
Run the script i.e., $ python3 add\_suffix\_asn1c.py

#Step 5
Compile. There will be errors at the test files. Just add the suffix to the functions that call the asn1c generated functions.
